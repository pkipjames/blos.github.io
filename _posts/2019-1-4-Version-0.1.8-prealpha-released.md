Hello, and it's been awhile since I made a post about BlueLight. I've gotten some new hardware to test and add. One of the devices was a fingerscanner and I've started adding support. Besides the standard updating of packages, the only major thing in this update is the new bootsplash added via Plymouth. That's it for the new release, I hope everyone continues supporting BlueLight so that it may be seen as a very capable operating system once it's fully done.
