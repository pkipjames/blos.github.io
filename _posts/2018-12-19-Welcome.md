Hello everyone, I'm @SpaceboyRoss01. I'm the lead developer and founder of BlueLight. I started this project with in mind of making OS.js be used more and pushing it to it's limits. I started working on this project when it was called OS.js Linux and that was about 12 days ago. I'm happy to work on this project to bring everyone a stable web based operating system that is bootable.
