Hello, and I'm here to talk about the update which was released today labeld `0.1.6-prealpha`. This was a quick update which added a license agreement section and timezone selection to the installer. The update also removes Chromium with Electron. The last thing in the update is the dark theme which is now included. That's it for the new release, I hope everyone continues supporting BlueLight so that it may be seen as a very capable operating system once it's fully done.
